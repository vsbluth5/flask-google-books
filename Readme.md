# Flask Birthstone Lab

The goal of this lab is to create a web application that takes in a user's birth month, and outputs their birthstone. For example, someone born in December should be told that their birthstone is Turquoise.

Some of the styling has been done for you, but the rest of the application needs to be created in `model.py`, `routes.py`, `index.html`, and `results.html`.

Don't forget to preview and test your application as you work!

## Bonus Challenges

**1.** Style the results page so it matches the index.

**2.** Make the results page output a picture and a description of the gemstone in addition to the name of the birthstone.

**3.** Create an "About" page with similar styling and link it to the index.

**4.** Make your own web application (remember, it must take input and output manipulated data).

## Quick Setup:

Code to help Flask locate your app and launch it properly:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=main.py
export FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

If you get character set errors, use these two additional lines:
```bash
export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8
export LANG=en_US.utf-8
```

Code to run flask:
```bash
flask run
```
